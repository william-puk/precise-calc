# Feature Specification: Precise Decimal and Hex Calculator

**Feature Branch**: `001-could-you-write`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Could you write a GoLang program that does simple math operations on decimal numbers and hex numbers, while preserving the precision. It should do the following:
- accept a string that specify the equation.
- examples: "0.0000000000000001 + 0.1 + -99999999999999 - 0xab91"
- specification of the the input string:
- they can be categorised as 3 categories:
- blank characters like spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.
- 1-character width math operators: "+", "-", "x", "/"
- other groups of continuous non-blank characters representing the numbers, that contains only these regex character set: [A-Fa-f0-9x]
- if it starts with "0x" or "-0x",
- leftmost "-", if exists, mean the number is negative
- after "0x" or"-0x", it is a hex unsigned big int bytes
- otherwise, it is signed decimal numbers
- performs the calculation of the equation, math operators precedence shall be followed.
- print the result"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user needs to perform mathematical calculations using a mix of decimal numbers (including very small or very large precision) and hexadecimal numbers, while maintaining exact precision throughout the computation. The user provides a mathematical expression as a string and receives the computed result.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a string containing decimal numbers and basic operators, **When** the calculator processes "0.1 + 0.2", **Then** it returns the exact result without floating-point precision loss
2. **Given** a string containing hexadecimal numbers, **When** the calculator processes "0xab91 + 100", **Then** it correctly converts hex to decimal, performs the operation, and returns the result
3. **Given** a string with mixed decimal and hex numbers, **When** the calculator processes "0.0000000000000001 + 0.1 + -99999999999999 - 0xab91", **Then** it maintains precision for all number types and applies correct operator precedence
4. **Given** a string with whitespace, **When** the calculator processes "  0.5   +   0.3  ", **Then** it ignores whitespace and computes the correct result
5. **Given** a string with multiplication and division, **When** the calculator processes "2 x 3 / 6", **Then** it follows mathematical operator precedence (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when dividing by zero?
- How does the system handle extremely large numbers that exceed typical integer limits?
- What occurs when invalid characters are present in the input string?
- How are negative hexadecimal numbers handled (e.g., "-0xab91")?
- What happens with malformed number formats?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a mathematical expression as a string input
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse decimal numbers with arbitrary precision (including very small decimals like 0.0000000000000001)
- **FR-003**: System MUST parse hexadecimal numbers prefixed with "0x" or "-0x"
- **FR-004**: System MUST support negative numbers for both decimal and hexadecimal formats
- **FR-005**: System MUST support four basic mathematical operators: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (x), and division (/)
- **FR-006**: System MUST follow standard mathematical operator precedence (multiplication and division before addition and subtraction)
- **FR-007**: System MUST ignore whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) in the input string
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve precision throughout all calculations without rounding errors
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that number tokens contain only valid characters from the set [A-Fa-f0-9x]
- **FR-010**: System MUST output the final calculated result
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle division by zero with appropriate error handling
- **FR-012**: System MUST reject input containing invalid characters outside the specified format

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Mathematical Expression**: A string containing numbers, operators, and whitespace that represents a calculation to be performed
- **Number Token**: A continuous sequence of valid characters representing either a decimal or hexadecimal number
- **Operator Token**: Single-character mathematical operators (+, -, x, /) that define operations between numbers
- **Calculation Result**: The final computed value maintaining the precision of the input numbers
